# Fetal brain snATACseq analyses (version 1)

Initial approach was to run FC and GE snATACseq data together using ArchR. Much replicated code here that is optimised in version 2 (but some nice tid bits that may be useful in the future that we didn't use).

Datasets for peak correspondence

+ [Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al. 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32610082/) - Bulk (e.g. FC, MGE, CGE, LGE)
 
+ [Song et al. 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33057195/) - FACS ExN, InN, RG and IP 
 
+ [Ziffra et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34616060/) - snATACseq from several regions of cortex (just test PFC) and MGE
 
+ [Trevino et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34390642/) - scATACseq from cortex (not subdivided) â€“ do against our FC
