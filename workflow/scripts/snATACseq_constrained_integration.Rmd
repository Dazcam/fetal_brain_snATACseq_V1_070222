snATACseq analysis with ArchR - constrained integration.

*** 

### Results {.tabset}

#### Constrained Integration 

The results from the unconstrained analysis are used to inform the constrained analysis. So we assign the RNA cluster IDs found in the ATAC clusters to broader groups i.e. InN-1/4 is assigned to InN, but note this is only to help inform the algorithm of the broad cell category each cell-type is likely to derive from, it will not necessarily clump all InNs into one broad category after constrained integration.
