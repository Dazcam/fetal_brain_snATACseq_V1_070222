snATACseq analysis with ArchR - cluster QC 1.

### Results {.tabset}

#### Cluster QC {.tabset}

Remove clusters that do not have >= 30 cells in at least 2 donors

+ Cell count at this stage = `r length(archR$cellNames)`
+ Clusters to be removed = `r cluster_list`
+ No. of cells to be removed = `r length(archR$cellNames) - length(cells_to_keep)`
+ Cell count after QC = `r length(archR.2$cellNames)`

**Cell counts per donor in each cluster**
