### Results {.tabset}

#### Cluster QC {.tabset}

Remove clusters that have < 10 cells from 2 out of 3 donors

+ Cell count at this stage = `length(archR$cellNames)`
+ Clusters to be removed = `cluster_list`
+ No. of cells to be removed = `length(archR$cellNames) - length(cells_to_keep)`
+ Cell count after QC = `length(archR.2$cellNames)`

**Cell counts per donor in each cluster**
